 
i.AF  - Couchbase Url Shortener Service
=================================================
Adventures with Visual Studio 2013, C#, MVC 5 and WebApi 2

The following project is the production quality reference implementation 
of a great Url Shortener web application built with a fantastic NoSql 
database as the main data store.

Couchbase 2.2.1 + Visual Studio 2013 is all you need to get started.

Currently we run the same code in production and you can track
